name = "comfyui-ipanimate"
description = "This is a project that generates videos frame by frame based on IPAdapter+ControlNet. Unlike [a/Steerable-motion](https://github.com/banodoco/Steerable-Motion), we do not rely on AnimateDiff. This decision is primarily due to the fact that the videos generated by AnimateDiff are often blurry. Through frame-by-frame control using IPAdapter+ControlNet, we can produce higher definition and more controllable videos."
